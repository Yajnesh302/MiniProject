# **RISK-BASED ANALYSIS USING STATIC AND DYNAMIC IDENTIFIERS**

##  1.ABSTRACT
When there are large gatherings and conferences, there is always additional threat from unknown 
sources that often go undetected through traditional systems. Failing to do so results wide range of negative outcomes including impact to your group’s reputation a potential lawsuit. With large 
event, the potential for risk often grows with the number of people in attendance. Unfortunately, 
people can be unpredictable. Being able to recognize security threats, particularly on a level that is proportionate to the size of the event and in a way that suits the various event details, is crucial for ensuring the safety of all guests.

## 2.INTRODUCTION
This technology is capable of identifying objects that exist in images and videos and tracking them. Object Recognition also known as Object Detection, has various applications like face recognition, body movement pattern analysis, and lot moreConsidering large gatherings or events it’s difficult to secure the environment by checking each and every person.

So using Artificial intelligence and machine learning the crowd can be continuously monitored with the help of pre-defined data and real-time object detection.Using this data any kind of undesirable movement or hazardous equipment can be easily detected.

One of the significant applications of object recognition is in crowd monitoring and management, especially in large gatherings or events where it is difficult to secure the environment by checkingeach and every person. With the help of pre-defined data and real-time object detection, AI-powered systems can continuously monitor crowds, detecting any kind of undesirable movement or hazardous equipment.

The benefits of object recognition in crowd management are immense, as it helps identify and 
prevent potential threats or hazards before they occur. For instance, detecting a person carrying a weapon or suspicious equipment in a crowd can alert security personnel in real-time, allowing them to take swift action to prevent any untoward incidents.

**Weihong Deng et al., [1]** have examined that provides an overview of deep face recognition techniques. It discusses the historical development, key components, various approaches, challenges, and future directions in the field of face recognition, specifically focusing on deep learning-based methods.

They discuss the design choices and optimizations made in MobileNets, such as depth-wise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and the use of ReLU6 activation function, which served as the foundation for MobileNetV2.

**G. Gayathri et al., [8]** Real time object detection is one of the challenging task as it need faster computation power in identifying the object at that time. However the data generated by any real time system are unlabelled data which often need large set of labeled data for effective training purpose. This paper proposed a faster detection method for real time object detection based on convolution neural network model called as Single Shot Multi-Box Detection (SSD).

**Sheng Chen et al., [9]** have analyzed MobileFaceNets, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for real-time face verification on mobile devices with limited computational resources.

It introduces the concept of anchor boxes, which are used to improve localization accuracy, and uses a grid-based approach to assign objects to specific grid cells for detection. The YOLO algorithm achieves real-time object detection with competitive accuracy and processing speed.


## 4.METHODOLOGY
The proposed solution should use some form of analytics to be able to profile the individuals within a video stream. There are multiple ways to mitigate the risk. Some of them are discussed below

### _Using a pre-defined watch list_
There are pre-determined datasets of individuals who pose a certain level of threat in certain events and with correct context, those can be identified. Video surveillance with intelligent data analytics can identify Persons of Interest (POIs) in real-time with live facial recognition, enabling your security team to rapidly respond to threats while protecting the privacy of bystanders.

### _Facial Recognition_
Facial recognition is a technology that uses machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and verify a person's identity based on their facial features. It works by analyzing various unique features of a person's face, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the jawline. These features are then compared to a database of known faces to determine the identity of the person. Facial recognition technology has a wide range of applications, including security systems, access control, and identification verification. However, it has also raised concerns around privacy and data protection, as the technology can potentially be used for mass surveillance and tracking.

### _Object Recognition_
Identifying unidentified or unrequired objects that people carry in a place of concern. On positive recognition, there should be a notification system in place to alert the authorities and automatically update the risk profile of the person of interest. You are free to use any existing algorithms for object recognition.
